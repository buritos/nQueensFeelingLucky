#nQueensFeelingLucky

A lucky program that finds a solution for a large n queens problem.

This program uses a minimum conflicts approach to find a solution to the n queens problem for large n values.

A brute force solution to the n queens problem would be intractable for problems of n > 20, as 20! = 2433*10<sup>18</sup>. If the goal is to find a single solution the min-conflicts algorithm will usually find one in less than 50 steps on average, even for very large n values.

The program was developed for the purpose of having fun while practicing algorithms.
